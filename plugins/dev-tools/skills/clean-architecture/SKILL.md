# Clean Architecture — scaffold or retrofit

Sets a project onto a Clean Architecture layout — **Domain**, **Application**, **Infrastructure**, **Api/Presentation**, and an **optional CrossCutting** — or brings an existing one into line. Two modes, resolved in Phase 0:

- **New project** → Phase 3A scaffolds from scratch.
- **Existing project (retrofit)** → Phase 3B audits first, proposes one full move/rename plan, and only executes after a single bulk approval.

**Deliberately out of scope:** this skill never touches `docs/` — specs, ADRs and the personal knowledge base are `implement-change` and `knowledge-base`'s job, not this one's — and it never commits, pushes or opens a PR. Hand off to `commit-push` and `create-pr` once the structure is in place.

**Stack-agnostic by design, but not template-agnostic about the rule.** The four/five layers and the dependency rule below are the invariant. How they're realised — projects vs. folders vs. packages, which CLI scaffolds them, which tool does migrations or background jobs — comes from **the stack you are in**, resolved in Phase 2. Never impose a `.csproj`-per-layer layout on a Node or Python project just because that's the shape of the motivating example; never invent a framework convention you haven't verified.

---

## The dependency rule — the actual "clean" in Clean Architecture

```
Domain  ←  Application  ←  Infrastructure
              ↑
         Api / Presentation  (composes everything at the edge)
```

- **Domain** depends on **nothing** — no ORM types, no HTTP types, no framework, no other layer.
- **Application** depends only on **Domain**. It defines *ports* (interfaces) for whatever it needs from the outside world (persistence, clock, external services) — it never implements them.
- **Infrastructure** implements Application's ports, and may depend on **Domain + Application**.
- **Api/Presentation** depends on **Application** to run use cases, and composes concrete **Infrastructure** implementations only at the composition root (DI wiring / startup) — not by calling Infrastructure code directly from a handler or controller.
- **CrossCutting** (only if it earns its place — see Phase 1) holds shared *technical* concerns used by two or more layers that aren't Domain (a logging abstraction, a base exception type, a constants file). It never holds business logic, and Domain still doesn't depend on it if Domain doesn't need to.

This graph matters more than the folder names. A project with unconventional names but a clean dependency graph is closer to "done" than one with the textbook names and a `Domain` entity that imports an ORM attribute. Say so, loudly, whenever Phase 3B finds a violation — a misplaced file is a tidiness issue; a broken dependency direction is a correctness issue.

---

## Phase 0 — Mode and stack

- **New vs. retrofit** — is there already source code, or a manifest, in the target directory? If it's empty (or just scaffolding from another skill, e.g. a fresh `git init`), this is a new project. Otherwise it's a retrofit.
- **Detect the stack from evidence**, never from a guess: `package.json` / `pnpm-workspace.yaml` / `turbo.json` (Node/TS), `*.csproj` / `*.sln` (.NET), `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt` (Python), `pom.xml` / `build.gradle*` (Java/Kotlin), `go.mod` (Go), `Cargo.toml` (Rust), or whatever else is actually there. On a genuinely new project with nothing yet, ask which language/framework instead of assuming — the answer decides everything in Phase 2.
- **Read the conventions file** — `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `.cursorrules` — if present. It outranks this skill on any naming or tooling choice it already records.

---

## Phase 1 — The structural decisions (ask, don't assume)

**Ask the app/solution name directly in chat** (free text — this isn't a decision with trade-offs, so don't burn an `AskUserQuestion` on it) if it isn't already obvious from the repo name or the conversation.

Then resolve the axes below. **Skip any axis evidence already answers** — an existing `docker-compose.yml` means "yes, Docker" without asking; an existing `Commands/`/`Queries/` split means CQRS is already the answer. For a genuinely new project, batch the rest into `AskUserQuestion` calls (max 4 per call), each with a recommended default sized for a small/personal project so the user can fast-path one approval instead of relitigating every axis:

1. **Scope** — one deployable service in this repo, or several (a small monorepo of services)? This decides whether Domain/Application/Infrastructure are shared across services or split per service. *Default recommendation: one service.*
2. **CQRS or plain use-cases** in Application — separate Commands/Queries handlers, or a single `UseCases/` folder when reads and writes don't genuinely diverge? *Default: plain use-cases; CQRS only once read and write models actually differ.*
3. **Persistence** — is there a database at all (a pure gateway/BFF may have none)? If yes, which engine, and which migration tool (Flyway, the ORM's own migrations, Alembic, Prisma Migrate, Liquibase, or none/manual)? *Default: the migration tool the stack's own ecosystem defaults to, unless the user already has a preference.*
4. **Containerization** — Docker for local dev? A single `Dockerfile`, or `docker-compose` with per-environment overrides (`docker-compose.override.yml` for local, one file per further environment the user actually has — name them after what the user calls those environments, don't assume "homolog" or "staging")? *Default: a single Dockerfile + docker-compose for local dev only, until there's a second environment to justify more files.*
5. **Background jobs / scheduled work** — needed at all? If yes, which mechanism for this stack (Hangfire/Quartz.NET, Celery, BullMQ, a cron container, cloud scheduler, …)?
6. **Auth** — needed at this layer, or handled upstream (gateway, BFF)? If needed, which mechanism (JWT, OAuth/OIDC, session)?
7. **Test scope beyond unit tests** — integration tests? End-to-end? *Default: unit tests now, integration tests added when there's infrastructure worth testing against.*
8. **CrossCutting** — is there real shared *technical* code, used by two or more layers, that isn't Domain (logging abstraction, base exceptions, constants)? Only create the layer if yes — an empty `CrossCutting` folder kept "just in case" is noise, same as an empty section in a written record.

Record the answers; Phase 2 and Phase 3 both key off them, and Phase 4's report restates them so the user can sanity-check what was assumed vs. decided.

## Phase 2 — Resolve the stack's own idiomatic realisation

Translate the layers into what this stack's ecosystem actually does, not a transliteration of another stack's shape. Verify conventions you aren't certain of (`WebFetch`/`WebSearch` against the framework's own docs or starter template) rather than guessing — a wrong convention is worse than asking.

| Stack | Realisation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **.NET (C#)** | One project per layer under `src/`, wired with `ProjectReference`s that enforce the dependency rule: `<App>.Domain` (zero deps) ← `<App>.Application` ← `<App>.Infrastructure`; `<App>.Api` (Program.cs, minimal API endpoints or controllers, `appsettings*.json`, `Dockerfile`) references `Application` and composes `Infrastructure` in `Program.cs`/DI extension methods. `<App>.CrossCutting` only if Phase 1 calls for it. Tests as `<App>.UnitTests` / `<App>.IntegrationTests` under `tests/`. A `.sln` ties it together. CQRS (if chosen) via a mediator library, `Application/Commands` + `Application/Queries`, pipeline behaviors under `Application/Common` (validation, logging, retry, transaction). Migrations under `Infrastructure/Persistence` (ORM) or `Infrastructure/Database/Scripts` + a `flyway.conf` / `DockerfileFlyway` (Flyway). |
| **Node / TypeScript** | Single service, one package: `src/{domain,application,infrastructure,api}` folders, same dependency rule enforced by import discipline (lint rule or dependency-cruiser, not just convention) since there's no compiler-enforced project boundary. Multiple services or shared libraries → a workspace (`pnpm`/`turborepo`/`nx`): `packages/{domain,application,infrastructure}` + `apps/api`, dependencies declared in `package.json` so the workspace tool enforces the graph. CQRS via a small command/query dispatcher or just typed use-case functions. Migrations via the ORM's own tool (Prisma Migrate, Drizzle Kit, TypeORM migrations) or Flyway if the user already runs it elsewhere. |
| **Python** | `src/<app_package>/{domain,application,infrastructure,api}` — a single distributable package; use `Protocol`/ABC classes in `application/` for ports. FastAPI/Flask app + routers live in `api/`. Migrations via Alembic (SQLAlchemy) or the ORM's own tool. Background jobs via Celery/RQ/APScheduler. Tests under `tests/{unit,integration}`. |
| **Java / Kotlin** | Multi-module Gradle/Maven, one module per layer (`domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`, `api`), module `build.gradle`/`pom.xml` dependencies enforcing the direction — same shape as .NET's projects. Migrations via Flyway or Liquibase (both are first-class in this ecosystem). |
| **Go** | Idiomatic Go, not a transliteration: `cmd/<app>/main.go` as the entrypoint (Api/Presentation), `internal/{domain,application,infrastructure}` as packages — Go's own `internal/` visibility rule already enforces "nothing outside this module can import it," which is most of the dependency rule for free. Don't invent an "Api project" — `cmd/` + `internal/` *is* the Go convention. |
| **Anything else** | Same four concepts, placed at whatever root the ecosystem itself expects (usually `src/`). Confirm the layout against that ecosystem's own official guide before creating it, and say in chat what you verified it against. |

---

## Phase 3A — New project: scaffold gate

Show the **complete planned tree** — every directory and the key files in each (project/package manifests, `Dockerfile`(s), `docker-compose*.yml` if chosen, the solution/workspace file) — in chat. **Wait for approval before creating anything.**

Once approved:

- **Prefer the stack's own scaffolding CLI over hand-written project files** — `dotnet new classlib`/`webapi`, the workspace tool's own `create`/`init`, `poetry new`/`uv init`, `go mod init` — so every generated project actually builds on the first try. Adapt afterwards: wire cross-project references, delete default template stubs (`Class1.cs`, `WeatherForecast`, …), set up the composition root.
- **Wire the dependency direction for real**, not just via folder names — `.NET` `ProjectReference`s, workspace `dependencies`, Python imports, Go's `internal/` boundary. Verify afterwards that Domain has zero outward dependencies (check its manifest/imports, don't just assume the scaffold got it right).
- **Only create what Phase 1 actually asked for.** No empty `CrossCutting`, no `Commands`/`Queries` split without CQRS, no migration folder without a chosen tool, no second `docker-compose` override without a second environment to justify it.

---

## Phase 3B — Existing project: retrofit gate

1. **Map every existing source file to the layer it *should* be in**, based on what it actually does — not its current folder name:
   - Touches HTTP/request/response objects, or a UI/CLI entrypoint → **Api/Presentation**.
   - A business rule with no external dependency (no I/O, no framework type) → **Domain**.
   - Orchestrates a use case, calling out to ports it doesn't implement itself → **Application**.
   - Touches a database, filesystem, network call, message broker or third-party SDK → **Infrastructure**.
2. **Flag dependency-rule violations first and loudest** — Domain importing an ORM/HTTP type, Application referencing a concrete Infrastructure class instead of its own port, Api calling Infrastructure directly instead of through Application. These are correctness problems; surface them ahead of merely-misnamed folders, and say explicitly which rule each one breaks.
3. **Produce one plan**: every move (`from → to`), every rename, and every import/namespace path that the move will break and needs updating. Show the **whole plan** in chat as a single block — don't dribble it out file by file.
4. **Wait for one explicit bulk approval.** This repo's retrofit convention is a full plan approved once, then executed end to end — not a per-file gate like the message/PR gates elsewhere in this plugin. If the user asks to change part of the plan, revise and re-show the whole thing before executing anything.
5. **Execute**, once approved:
   - `git mv` for every move — never a plain filesystem move — so history survives.
   - Fix every import/namespace statement the moves broke. A move that leaves a broken import behind is not done.
   - Run the project's own build/typecheck (from the manifest found in Phase 0) afterwards. Fix whatever it surfaces; never leave the tree in a worse state than before the retrofit started.
6. **This is a structural refactor, not a feature.** Recommend doing it on its own branch (e.g. `refactor/clean-architecture-layout`) before anything else lands on top of it, and hand off to `commit-push` / `create-pr` once the build is green. This skill does not commit.

---

## Phase 4 — Report

Short and factual:

- **The tree produced**, or **the move plan executed** (from → to, one line each).
- **Phase 1 decisions** — what was answered vs. what evidence already decided, so the user can sanity-check the assumptions.
- **Dependency-rule violations** found — which were fixed by the move, and which need a design decision beyond a mechanical move (name these explicitly; don't silently leave one unresolved).
- **Build/typecheck result**, with the baseline, for a retrofit.
- **Next step** — the work is uncommitted: `commit-push` to commit (and push), then `create-pr` to open the PR. Do not run them from here.
