# outputs/

Artifacts generated from the knowledge base for a purpose: something to print, to send, to answer one question, or a piece of work that evolves in versions. Durable knowledge does not live here — it lives in `../wiki/`.

## Where things go

```
outputs/<area>/
├── study/          study material: summaries, mock exams, solved exams — printable (.docx/.pdf), with the .md source next to it
├── deliverables/   things that go to other people: blog posts, emails, presentation scripts, slides, embeds
├── answers/        one-off answers to a specific question
└── work/<name>/    work that evolves in versions
    ├── README.md   what it is, current version, short changelog (one line per version)
    └── v1/ v2/ …   one self-contained folder per version
```

- `<area>` is one of the areas `../wiki/` already uses (a course, a project, a topic). Don't invent a grouping the wiki doesn't have. What fits no area goes in `general/`. If the wiki has no areas, drop the `<area>/` level.
- Pick the purpose folder by what the output is **for**, not by its file type. The type (summary, chart, email, slides…) is a column in the index, not a folder.
- Inside `study/`, each piece of study material (a summary, a mock exam, a solved exam) is its own folder named by what it covers, without a date — e.g. `study/summary-<scope>/` holding the `.md` source, the `.docx` and the `.pdf`. The name never changes: the files always hold the latest version, and the version number and date are printed on the document itself.
- Inside `deliverables/` and `answers/`, name files `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.<ext>`. A set of files that belong together (a script + the image it generates) gets its own `YYYY-MM-DD-slug/` subfolder.
- In `work/<name>/`, each version is a frozen folder: once `v3/` exists, `v2/` is not edited. The changelog lives in `work/<name>/README.md`, not in the index below.
- Create folders when the first output needs them — don't pre-create empty ones.

## Outputs never repeat the wiki

- An output is a view of the wiki made for a purpose. It links to the articles it is based on instead of copying them.
- If producing an output uncovers something durably true that the wiki doesn't say yet, put that in the wiki (through a note or `compile-wiki`), and keep only the purpose-specific part here.
- Promoting an output means folding into the wiki **only what is new** — then set its status to `promoted → [[Article]]`.
- **The exception is `study/`.** Study material is made to be printed and studied from, so it does contain the material — but it is always derived from the wiki (and `raw/`), and is never promoted into the wiki as a whole. Anything new it surfaces goes into the wiki through a note.

## What each output is based on

Not in the index — in the output itself:

- `.md` outputs start with a frontmatter block:

  ```markdown
  ---
  date: 2026-10-15
  type: summary
  based_on:
    - "[[Some Article]]"
    - raw/some/file.pdf
  status: draft
  ---
  ```

  Use `outside the KB` in `based_on` for anything that comes from general knowledge or a web search.
- A `.docx`/`.pdf` is generated from a `.md` source next to it, which carries that frontmatter.
- Anything else (an image, an HTML embed, a script) goes in its own subfolder with a short `README.md` carrying the same fields.

## Index

One row per output, added by whoever creates it and kept in sync when files move. A `work/<name>/` is one row pointing at its folder, updated when a new version is added.

- **What for** — one short sentence. Details go in the output itself.
- **Status** — `draft`, `final` or `promoted → [[Article]]`.

| Date | File | Type | What for | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
